#  Report — act1_2p_si_eda_2_25_gancino

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this project is to perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset containing synthetic information about books.  
The goal of the EDA is to understand the structure, relationships, and distribution of the variables in the dataset in order to detect patterns, correlations, and possible outliers.  

This report documents the complete analytical process carried out in **Google Colab**, following the stages of:
- Data inspection and cleaning  
- Imputation of missing values  
- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis

## 2. Dataset Description
The dataset used, **DatasetLibros.csv**, was generated using a Python script called **baselibros.py**.  
This script creates synthetic records of books using the `random` and `os` libraries, combining predefined lists of authors, categories, editors, and formats.

Each record represents a different book with the following variables:

| Column | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `libro` | Title of the book generated by combining prefixes and categories. |
| `autor` | Name of the author (randomly selected). |
| `editorial` | Publisher or editorial. |
| `anio_publicacion` | Publication year (range: 2000–2022). |
| `num_paginas` | Number of pages (range: 120–800). |
| `formato` | Type of format (physical or digital). |
| `categoria` | Field or area of knowledge. |
| `rating` | Book rating (0 to 5 scale). |
| `popularidad_libro` | Popularity level (1 to 10 scale). |

## 3. Data Cleaning
Before starting the analysis:
- Duplicated rows were removed.  
- Missing values were checked and filled using the **mean** for numerical data and the **mode** for categorical data.  
- The dataset was reviewed to ensure consistent types and valid ranges.

This ensured that the data was clean, complete, and ready for exploration.

## 4. Univariate Analysis
The univariate analysis focuses on understanding each variable separately.

### • Numerical Variables
The variables `anio_publicacion`, `num_paginas`, `rating`, and `popularidad_libro` were analyzed using histograms to visualize their distribution, detect outliers, and observe general trends.

### • Categorical Variables
For categorical variables (`autor`, `editorial`, `formato`, and `categoria`), bar charts were used to identify the most frequent values and the predominant types of books.

## 5. Bivariate Analysis
To analyze relationships between two variables:
- A **correlation matrix** was computed to evaluate the linear relationships among numerical variables.  
- A **scatter plot** was used to compare `num_paginas` and `rating`, revealing whether longer books tend to have higher or lower ratings.  
- A **boxplot** compared `popularidad_libro` by `formato`, showing the differences in popularity between physical and digital books.

---

## 6. Multivariate Analysis
A **correlation heatmap** was generated to observe the interactions among all numerical variables simultaneously.  
Additionally, a 3-variable scatter plot was created (`rating` vs `popularidad_libro` with color indicating `num_paginas`) to visualize combined patterns among these metrics.

---

## 7. Findings and Discussion
- The distribution of `rating` values tends to concentrate around medium to high scores (3–5).  
- Physical and digital books show similar popularity levels, but digital formats exhibit slightly higher dispersion.  
- The number of pages has a weak correlation with both rating and popularity, indicating that book length does not strongly affect readers’ evaluations.  
- The categories with the highest representation belong to **Engineering**, **Education**, and **Computer Science**, which dominate the dataset.

---

## 8. Conclusion
The EDA provided a clear understanding of the dataset’s structure and relationships.  
No major data quality issues were detected. The variables show balanced distributions and reasonable correlations.  
The analysis confirms that **ratings and popularity are mostly independent of book length**, and both formats maintain similar performance.  

This exploratory process sets a solid foundation for future predictive or descriptive modeling based on these synthetic data.
