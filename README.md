# Book Rating Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project applies a multiple linear regression model to predict the rating of books based on their attributes such as author, publisher, publication year, format, number of pages, category, and popularity.
The project demonstrates the use of supervised learning techniques to analyze relationships between numerical and categorical features.

## Task
Predict the rating (0–5) of a book given its metadata.

## Tools used
Python 3
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib

# Dataset Generation
Script used:
baselibros.py — a Python script developed to synthetically generate book data for regression analysis.

## How the data was obtained:
The dataset was generated using a custom Python script named baselibros.py.
This script synthetically creates a realistic dataset of books by combining randomized attributes using Python’s random library.

Each record represents a book with attributes such as:

**libro:** generated by combining a random prefix and category

**autor:** chosen from a list of fictitious authors

**editorial:** randomly selected publisher

**anio_publicacion:** random year between 2000 and 2024

**num_paginas:** random number between 120 and 800

**formato:** randomly “Físico” or “Digital”

**categoria:** general field such as Ingeniería, Informática, etc.

**rating:** random float from 0 to 5

**popularidad_libro:** random integer from 1 to 500

This synthetic generation ensures privacy, reproducibility, and enough variability for a regression model.
